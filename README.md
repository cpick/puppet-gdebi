## Overview

Package provider that uses gdebi to install a Debian package (.deb) file with its dependencies

## Module Description

The dpkg provider can also install a package from a .deb file, but it will not
install any needed dependencies first.

The apt provider can install a package and its dependencies, but the package
must be fetched from a repository, not a local .deb file.

The gdebi provider fills this gap.

## Setup

### What gdebi affects

* Installs the 'gdebi-core' package.
* Installs any requested pakage along with its dependencies.

## Usage

include gdebi

package { 'foo':
    provider => gdebi,
    source   => "/path/to/foo.deb",
}

## Limitations

Compatible with Ubuntu and Debian.
